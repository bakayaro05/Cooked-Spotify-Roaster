# 🎧 Spotify Playlist Roaster (Cooked)

A fun web app that takes a public Spotify playlist link, analyzes it, roasts your music taste, and assigns a **Vibe Score** — because your playlist deserves honest feedback.

This repository represents the **evolution of the Cooked project across multiple versions**, each exploring deeper levels of AI integration, frontend architecture, and user experience.

## 📌 Credits & Inspiration

The original idea was inspired by a YouTube video by **Manware**:

- **Channel:** https://www.youtube.com/@IAmManware  
- **Video:** *“19 ACTUALLY UNIQUE Projects That Get You A Job”*  
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muJf6SwEaa0  

This project is my **independent implementation and extension** of that idea.

## 🧭 Project Versions Overview

---

### 🔹 Version 1 — Core Playlist Roaster (MVP)

**Branch:** `main` / `v1`

The initial working version focused on proving the core idea.

#### Highlights
- Accepts a public Spotify playlist link
- Fetches playlist metadata via Spotify Web API
- Uses an LLM to generate:
  - A humorous roast
  - A vibe description
  - A numerical vibe score
- Typewriter-style animated text output
- Simple, clean UI

#### Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript  
- Backend: Node.js  
- Spotify Web API  
- LLM API  

This version validated the concept and end-to-end flow.

### 🔹 Version 2 — Wrapped-Style Visual Experience

**Branch:** `v2`

V2 explored presentation and animation, inspired by Spotify Wrapped.

#### What Changed
- Migration to React
- Slide-based UI for stats and roasts
- Initial GSAP animations
- Structured AI output instead of long text blocks

#### Key Learnings
- React hook order and render lifecycle
- Early architectural limitations
- Challenges mixing animations with React state

V2 was visually promising but structurally unstable — it set the stage for a full rewrite.

### 🔹 Version 3 — Cinematic Narrative Experience

**Branch:** `v3`

V3 is the **final and most complete iteration** of Cooked, including a full migration to React.

#### Major Additions
- Fully refactored React architecture
- Declarative slide system using derived state
- GSAP timelines with controlled sequencing
- Narrative slides between statistics
- Looping background videos (SPA-safe)
- Background music via a custom audio engine



#### Focus
- Stability over hacks
- Architectural correctness
- Narrative pacing
- End-to-end completion
